                        Self-taught, I have learned the fundamentals of web development from online videos and training sites, and through building projects. I have specialised in development using React, which I find versatile and a joy to use. The modular approach to building UI componenets is very satisfying and simple approach to development. My preferred code editor is Visual Studio Code.

                        The nature of software development â€“ thinking programmatically, solving problems and constructing solutions - is engaging and satisfying and I seek to develop a long-term career in the field.  I would love the opportunity to learn from experienced developers, gain exposure to industry practices and procedures, and to build my skill set.

                        Changing career into software development, I have spent the last 15 months learning to code. Self-taught, I have worked on a variety of personal projects, exploring using different libraries, frameworks and third-party APIs (see my website). Starting on the front end, I learnt HTML and CSS, along with JavaScript as my main programming language, before picking up libraries and frameworks. I have decided to specialise in React, which is a delight to use, flexible and powerful. I am however open to learning any technology, since all are tools to solving problems. Whilst I currently have no commercial experience, I feel I have a solid foundation of understanding and coding, and would be able to contribute significantly to the team at a company that is looking to develop its talent pool.
